/**
 * The board kept in Redis.
 *
 * Upstash's free tier allows half a million commands a month, so the shape here
 * is chosen to spend as few as possible rather than for how it would look in a
 * relational schema. Reading the whole board is two commands and never fifty:
 * the ranking is one sorted set, and every player's row lives as a field of one
 * hash, so fifty rows come back in a single `HMGET`.
 *
 * The names live in a hash of their own, keyed by the folded form, which is what
 * makes a name unique across the board.
 */

/**
 * Preview deployments and production share one database, because the
 * integration injects one set of credentials into every environment. Without a
 * prefix, testing a branch writes to the board people are playing for — and a
 * name claimed by a test is never released, which is the whole point of that
 * rule. So every environment but production keeps its own keys.
 *
 * Vercel sets `VERCEL_ENV` to production, preview or development on its own.
 * Anywhere it is unset — a script run by hand against the real database — is
 * treated as development rather than as production, so the accident is a wasted
 * key rather than a polluted board.
